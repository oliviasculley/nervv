# NERVV (Novel Environment for Robotics VR Visualization)
NERVV is a standardized Unity platform for easily creating robotic simulations
with virtual reality.\
NERVV offers standardized interfaces for core robotic components and input/output
sources for easy integration, synchronization and control with real-world
manufacturing devices.

## Contribution
NERVV is an evolving specification and gladly welcomes all
[merge requests](https://gitlab.com/csculley/nervv/merge_requests).
Please follow the
[contribution guide](https://gitlab.com/csculley/nervv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to allow for speedy integration!
The [wiki](https://gitlab.com/csculley/nervv/wikis/Home)
is also currently in development and contains helpful information and examples
for integration and contribution.

## External Dependencies
The sample menu depends on the
[SteamVR Unity Asset store package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamvr-plugin-32647).
The sample ROS input and outputs rely on the
[ROS-Sharp Unity Asset store package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/ros-107085).
Doosan, Kuka, and Sawyer robotic models are based off of CAD data made available by [Doosan Robotics](https://www.doosan.com),
[Kuka Robotics](https://www.kuka.com), and [Rethink Robotics](https://www.rethinkrobotics.com/)
respectively, and are included for educational and example purposes only.
