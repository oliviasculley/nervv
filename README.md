# NERVV (Novel Environment for Robotics VR Visualization)
NERVV is a standardized Unity platform for easily creating robotic simulations
with virtual reality.\
NERVV offers standardized interfaces for core robotic components and input/output
sources for easy integration, synchronization and control with real-world
manufacturing devices.

## Contribution
NERVV is an evolving specification and gladly welcomes all
[merge requests](https://gitlab.com/csculley/mtconnectvr/merge_requests).
The [wiki](https://gitlab.com/csculley/mtconnectvr/wikis/Home)
is currently in development and contains helpful information and examples
for integration and contribution.

## External Dependencies
The sample menu depends on the
[SteamVR Unity Asset store package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamvr-plugin-32647).
The sample ROS input and outputs rely on the
[ROS-Sharp Unity Asset store package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/ros-107085).
Doosan and Kuka Robotic models are based off of CAD data available by [Doosan Robotics](https://www.doosan.com)
